# Module 3 Challenge [Bootcamp Web Developer]

## Description

This repo contains the challenge 3 for the bootcamp.
This is a modified starter code to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.
